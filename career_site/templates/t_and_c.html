                                    <li>All users who visit linkedincareer and wish to conduct business through the
                                        site are expressly implied to have read, understood, accept, and agree to abide
                                        by the conditions, terms and rules laid down here.

                                    <li>linkedincareer acts as a bridge between recruiters, recruitment consultants,
                                        and the candidates to ensure requirements of the parties involved are met. We
                                        act in good faith when candidates or consultants provide information based on
                                        which we process profiles. The factual accuracies given in a candidate’s Resume
                                        must be verified by the recruiter and we shall not be held responsible for the
                                        same.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Once an application is processed and an interview arranged, it is the
                                        responsibility of the candidate to perform to his best so that the available
                                        position can be given to him. Our role ends with the arrangement of the
                                        interview and candidates must take it forward from there.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>No guarantee is made towards provision of a job placement just by virtue of
                                        registration on the website or attending an interview process.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>If a candidate gets multiple interview opportunities, linkedincareer attempts
                                        to advise candidates the best opportunity we consider most relevant to the
                                        candidate. However it is the candidate’s prerogative whether he wishes to be led
                                        by our counsel or not.
                                    </li>
                                    <li> Upon recruitment, a candidate has to give a written undertaking of working for
                                        a minimum period with the recruiting company and must abide by the same.
                                        linkedincareer will not be held liable if any candidate wishes to discontinue
                                        from a certain company due to any reasons whatsoever.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>The minimum expectations from both the recruiter and the candidate must be
                                        clearly understood by both the parties concerned and both the parties are
                                        expected to honour the same, without prejudice to linkedincareer
                                    </li>
                                    <li>linkedincareer will ensure that a candidate works for a minimum period of 6
                                        months, once assigned the job. However in the unexpected event of a candidate
                                        quitting within the referred period, we shall make every attempt to offer a
                                        replacing candidate to the company. However our liability after the minimum
                                        period shall end and we shall be under no obligation to process any other
                                        candidate, and if done shall be done under a fresh process.
                                    </li>
